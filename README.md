# React_Todo

This is a todo list application front-end created with React, Typescript, Vite, Vittest.

The purpose of this project is to create a simple application to learn the basic principles of React and unit testing. This is also my first introduction to unit testing react applications and working with vittest.

# Goal

To create a fullstack application that has some helpful examples of unit testing.
